No Dramas Investments has a number of "proof of concept" projects that have been in train since 2014\.

_5 Waratah Road, Engadine_

This investment is currently returning 6.8% for the investors. This is a straight residential acquisition that is zoned for future medium level density development.

In time, it is believed that this will be rezoned to core commercial / high level density development.

_1106-1108 Old Princes Highway, Engadine_

This is a dual occupancy development (permitting a total of 4 significant dwellings across two sites).

This "build and hold" development is anticipated to earn the investors 7.1% return per annum on their initial investment.

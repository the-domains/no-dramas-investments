No Dramas Investments was created in 2014\.

We created No Dramas Investments to access what we saw as long term property opportunities in the Sydney market.

Yep - that's right, another property investment group.

Unlike most people operating in the residential market in the last 2 years (or longer), we **only** take up opportunities that we regard as "long term holds".

That means we aren't your typical residential developer.

In fact, we don't think of ourselves as **DEVELOPERS** at all. We are _investors_ - and there is a big difference. We specifically look for opportunities that "work" on a long term hold basis.

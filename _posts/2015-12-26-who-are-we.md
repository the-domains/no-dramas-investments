# What or who is No Dramas Investments?

"Who are you?" I hear you ask.... Good question...

No Dramas Investments was created in 2014\.

We created No Dramas Investments to access what we saw as long term property opportunities in the Sydney market.

Yep - that's right, another property investment group. 

There is, however, a **BIG** difference in our approach and methodology.

Unlike most of our contemporaries, we are not investing in property in what has become the "traditional" format over the past few years. This, to us, appears to be the "_double your money by building a duplex_" crowd. (A pretty flawed investment fundamental if you ask us - although certainly something that will have worked in the Sydney property market in the past few years!)

At No Dramas Investments we are **only** interesting in taking up opportunities that we regard as "long term holds". This is across the property spectrum. Industrial, Residential and Commercial.

To us - that sets us apart from your typical investor, residential or otherwise. 

We don't think of ourselves as **DEVELOPERS** at all. We are _investors_ - and there is a big difference. We specifically look for opportunities that "work" on a long term hold basis.
